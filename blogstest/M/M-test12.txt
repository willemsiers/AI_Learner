Hi, my name's Steve and I've just entered the world of blogdom. But like a child, cluelessly born into the big wide world, this blog-birth was not a matter of choice. So thank you to Brother Andrew (a monk I once met in Devon) for setting this up and forcing it upon me without my realising, I'm sure it will provide me with many hours of fun. Even if nobody else finds it quite so entertaining.  All I can say is watch this space...theres gonna be some changes around here.  PS. If you want to see Brother Andrew's own personal blog, go to  urlLink andyandshona.blogs.com
urlLink      urlLink      Au Revoir & Auf Wiedersehen. Suddenly the world seems a better place!
urlLink      The picture says it all.
urlLink       Just 24 hours to go til we're all subjected to another 90 minutes of nail biting, as England face hosts Portugal in the Euro 2004 Quarter Finals. Recently Sven's men have made watching a Tim Henman Wimbledon match seem like a stroll in the park, and rollercoaster rides such as the France and Croatia games have certainly added a grey hair or two to my head. Fortunately wins against Switzerland and Croatia have seen Becks & Co through the group stage, largely thanks to the formidable form of Master/Sir/King(delete as appropriate)Rooney.  Tomorrow night could be a tough match and the England defence must improve on recent games if they are to tame the likes of Figo, Ronaldo and Deco. Still...we've got Beckham, Gerrard, Lampard, Owen, and of course...ROONEY!!! So who is there to fear? Nobody at all. So, COME ON ENGLAND!   PUNDIT STEVE PREDICTS: England 2 (Rooney, Owen) Portugal 1 (Ronaldo)
urlLink       Well after a week of sun, sand and scrumptious food I have returned to a wet, windy and woeful England. (Well, maybe 'woeful' is a bit much, but I couldn't think of anything else beginning with W!) I had a brilliant holiday in Northern Cyprus, unfortunately for the locals it was so hot they were punished with the sight of my legs for a week as the shorts, t-shirts and flip-flops remained permanent fixtures. I'm sure there will be some more holiday snaps on here soon, including possibly one or two of me jumping off a 2,500 foot high mountain......!
urlLink       Its definitely a case of the morning after the night before for me today, as I recover from a fantastic evening of music, drink, food and fun. Last night I played guitar at an acoustic gig at the Kerith Centre, Bracknell, and a great time was had by all. One of my regular bands (pictured) were the final act of the evening, we stripped things down a bit from our usual set to suit the unplugged vibe, and even changed our name for the event from Rod, Jane & Freddy to The Matt Price Band (guess who's idea that was?!).   Things started off well as our customary pre-gig Big Mac Meals went down a treat (thanks Ronald), while The Nexus Band and Rosie Donnan provided the nights early entertainment. Finally, after an interval and a buffet (more food!), it was our turn to take the stage. It was a decent performance on our behalfs, and it was great to have an extra backing vocalist and violinist as special guests for the gig. 120 people went home happy having seen and heard some brilliant acoustic music, all with a great message of faith, hope and love.   Tomorrow I am off to Cyprus for seven days in the sun, so make sure you don't miss those holiday snaps on my return next week!
urlLink     Carrying the hopes of a nation   After weeks of counting down, today marks the start of Euro 2004. Hosts Portugal kick things off against Greece this evening, while the one we've all been waiting for is just a day away. The 23 smart looking Englishmen and the 1 greying Swede above are genuinely thought to have a real chance of success this summer, but possibly the toughest test of all awaits them tomorrow night as they face France in their opening match. Expect a fascinating battle in the middle of the field as superstars Zidane, Vieira, Pires and Makelele take on the formidable Gerrard, Beckham, Scholes and Lampard. This should be a tight game and may be decided by just the one goal, so COME ON ENGLAND! YOU CAN DO IT!   PUNDIT STEVE PREDICTS: England 1 (Owen) France 1 (Henry)
urlLink        Tonight saw the return of the wonderful Fantasy Football! Baddiel and Skinner are back on the couch to bring us plenty of comical Euro 2004 action, and they started with a bang this evening. There were plenty of Big Ron jokes, David Seaman's Euro 96 penalty save against Scotland in Phoenix From The Flames, and of course the legendary Statto! If you never saw the show during its day make sure you don't miss out again this time, if you were a fan of this in the mid-1990s remember its on ITV now, not BBC2!
urlLink       Well it may have taken quitting my job to finally find a bit of spare time, but my temporary unemployment seems to have been a blessing in disguise. As you will see this blog has at last been updated (its amazing what a free afternoon can do!), and rest assured there is more to come. Until then, enjoy this particularly soothing picture of me relaxing with a nice cold pint of Grandpa's old cough medicine.
urlLink      Yes, the rumours are true...I have finally realised a lifelong dream and met a great hero of mine, Mr Ronald McDonald. Massive respect to the big man for taking some time out from his busy burger making schedule to have a chat and pose for this special photo. Over the years this man has provided me and my stomach with an immeasurable amount of pleasure. So Ronald, thank you.
urlLink     Apparently, the devil has all the best tunes. The New York Post once declared,  "Most Christian rock ranks right up there with the great plagues of the Bible, including rivers turning into blood, frogs raining from the sky, and those nasty angels of death" . For decades the very term 'rock' has been synonymous with sex, drugs, violence and all kinds of rebellious abuse.   Recently I read  urlLink 'Faith, God & Rock 'n' Roll' by Mark Joseph,  a book exploring the links between notions of modern music and spirituality, particularly Christianity. The fascinating accounts and comments within have helped reinforce and reinspire my belief that God can speak through music of all kinds, and is in fact doing so more and more within the contemporary worlds of rock and pop. Joseph observes and discusses the recent pattern whereby bands and musicians of faith have ignored the familiar and comfortable, yet often substandard and horrendously inward-looking Christian music scene; favouring the contemporary side of the industry - a tougher nut to crack, but a significantly wider audience to entertain.   By looking at bands/artists such as POD, Lauryn Hill, U2, Mary Mary, Creed and Sixpence None The Richer to name just a few, this book focuses on a handful of the acts to have broken into American charts with a spiritual message, yet a popular and relevant sound. The pattern is of course the same here in England, where we have witnessed the likes of Daniel & Natasha Bedingfield and Athlete invading the airwaves with the sorts of open beliefs that would have once been confined to strictly religious settings. Naturally, the shift is creating plenty of controversy and alarm from both sides of the camp. Religious quarters have expressed their concern at the willingness of people of faith to throw themselves into an apparently dangerous, evil setting; while hardened music lovers have questioned the supposed contradictions that exist between rock and religion - suggesting that those who combine the two either have a hidden agenda, or are simply fakes.   As a music loving Christian, I see it this way: firstly, God has told us to be  'in the world, but not of it'  - in other words to avoid 'worldly' or unholy ways of doing things, but certainly not distancing ourselves so much so that we cannot relate to the world any more. In bypassing the Christian music scene artists are rejecting a market that sometimes alienates itself from popular society, preferring their work to be heard by a larger, predominantly non-Christian audience - therefore  in the world , the challenge is then to not be  of it . Secondly, music is for everyone and therefore anyone should be able to produce it. To cast doubt over the legitimacy of music made by spiritual people for perhaps non-spiritual settings is not only restricting, but ultimately ignorant. For a band to be judged on anything other than their music is a bizarre concept, does the type of cereal our musicians prefer to eat affect our judgement over them as artists? So why should a personal belief in God harm someone's credibility within the music scene?   Ultimately, rock is about rebellion. And what greater rebellion than to refuse to conform to the predetermined ways of a supposedly non-conformist genre?   I accept that I may not have got it all right on this topic, so I'm interested in other peoples views on whether music/rock can or should be allowed to mix with religion or Christianity. Please feel free to leave any comments. Some other interesting faith/music views can be read on this thread I found on the  urlLink Drowned In Sound  message board, and this comment on a blog by  urlLink The Shiny Headed Prophet .   Discuss!
The time has come, oh yes. Almost 2 weeks ago I begged you not to miss what was coming; 1 week ago I kept you in suspense like a Friday evening Neighbours cliffhanger - by boasting of my near death experience. Now as promised, I can proudly present the eagerly awaited Steve Scott Paragliding Photos!   Running off the edge of a 2,500 foot high mountain in Northern Cyprus has to go down as one of the sillier things I have done in life, but surely one of the most exciting! Anyone who's done it before will understand what I am saying, it was an incredible feeling to be so high up in the air, legs dangling, supported only by a few strings! A must-do experience. But enough of the small talk, enjoy the photos.    urlLink       urlLink       urlLink       urlLink     Thanks very much to  urlLink Brother Andrew  for his help with the photos
urlLink      Its official! Watford FC were last night crowned champions of Ibiza after winning the prestigious (well, it is now!) Copa de Ibiza trophy. The Hornets succeeded where Beckham et al failed, by winning a penalty shoot out 5-4 to claim the title, having drawn 1-1 with Sheffield Wednesday after 90 minutes. Earlier in the tournament Watford disposed of Ibiza's finest side Portmany 4-1 en route to European glory.    Unfortunately this incredible triumph is not quite ranked highly enough to provide the mighty Golden Boys with a somewhat deserved automatic qualification for this years Champions League, but it sets us up nicely for this seasons inevitable cup and league quadruple: Copa de Ibiza, FA Cup, Worthington Cup (is it still called this these days?!), and the even more ridiculously named Coca Cola Championship (it'll always be "Division One...the old Division Two" to me!)
urlLink      Part 2 of the Northern Cyprus holiday snaps features myself as Captain Steve! Yes, they really did let me have a go at controlling this boat and putting the lives of 11 or 12 innocent people at risk. However, there was one event earlier in the week when 23 years of being me flashed before my eyes in a moment, and my life really was at risk! Fortunately for you this moment was captured on camera, and sometime next week I will be displaying some of those pictures on here as promised. So watch this space!
Its been almost 2 weeks since I returned from my holiday in Kyrenia, North Cyprus, so definitely about time you saw a few of my holiday snaps. Consider these merely a starter, something to whet the appetite - as very soon you will be treated to the main course, the real thing. The photos you see now are good, pleasant shots. But whatever you do, do not miss what is to come!   urlLink    Kyrenia from half way up St Hilarion mountain   urlLink    St Hilarion Castle   urlLink    The Old Harbour   urlLink    Me enjoying a picnic
urlLink     It may have taken three attempts, but this week I finally passed the dreaded driving test! After managing just two minors (although it felt like 22!) my examiner delivered the news I'd been waiting for, and no doubt the news my chauffeurs...sorry, parents had been waiting for also. The beast above is my wonderful car, a brand new Ferrari. It needs a name so any suggestions are welcome.
