Hey, I'm in Arizona!  I'm chillin here at the Cyber Cafe in the convention center, just waiting for the next seminar, "Tough questions on faith."  I'm really excited.  I'm gonna make this a really short post, and then check my email, because there are people waiting.  But the one thing I can say I learned is this...  God is much more than I ever imagined him to be.  Next time you pray, first just take some time to truly think about who God is.  Holy, and loving.  Wow, it's amazing.  Well, I'm gonna go now.  I'll try to update this again before I go back to Pennsylvania.  Catch ya later.    God Bless you.
Well, today is my last day in Pennsylvania.  Tomorrow I hit the road (and the air) for Phoenix.  Somehow, it seems odd that we're driving five hours east to the Atlantic Ocean.  Hahaha airports make no sense.  We drive to a different state, then get on a plane and fly back to our own state, then finally switch planes and fly to Phoenix.  No sense at all.  Oh yeah, I have a family picnic today too!  That's great!  I'm taking Maria with us, so we can have some time together before I leave.  I'm so excited.  I still have to buy a phone card and batteries!  Hah.  I can do that.  WHOO!  I'm so excited!  I can't handle it!  Praise Jesus for giving me this great opportunity to really experience him!  It's so wonderful!  I gotta go, or I'll be late for Sunday school.  See ya later!    God bless you.
I got a haircut today and I think it looks nice.  I am very pleased.  Megan Rich's sister did the job.  I will have to go to Dairy Queen tonight and tell Megan that.  Yes, I know Megan isn't working tonight.  Okay, fine the real reason I'm going is to see Maria, which probably won't even happen because it's hot today and odds are Dairy Queen is going to be very busy.  But I can still try.  Okay, it's time for some macaroni and cheese!  Later!   The words of a wise man:  "Good will come to him who is generous and lends freely, who conducts his affairs with justice."  -Unknown    God bless you.
If you're a young kid teenager type person, like me, and you go to youth conventions quite frequently, you've probably heard a song called "God of Wonders."  Well there's a line in the song that goes like this...  "Early in the morning, I will celebrate the light..."  And today I finally realized the truth to that statement.  I woke up at 7:30 AM this morning, and I looked out the window, and the sky was blue!  And the sun was shining!  The first thing I did was praise God for the sun!  Now, in case some of you are non-observant to the point of ignorance, Clearfield Pennsylvania has not seen the sun for almost two weeks!  But praise God still, because he gave us plenty of rain :)  1 day, 22 hours, 10 minutes until LIFE 2004!  Whoo!  I'm so pumped!  I can hardly think of anything else...  except for the fact that I seriously need a haircut.  I'm starting to look like I have a bush growing on my head.  I have to get some cameras too.  Like, now.  Unfortunately, I can only go to Wal Mart when someone volunteers to give me a ride.  Oh well, no biggy.  I'll get there.  Well it's time for breakfast now.  And maybe some video games.  Later on!    God bless you.
Perspective, or the ability to perceive things in their actual interrelations or comparative importance, can be quite hard to grasp sometimes.  I learned a lot just about five minutes ago.  My mom's friend gave birth to a son recently, and today our family was babysitting him.  He's so cute, just a little guy.  We were also babysitting his older brother, who is now about a year old.  Up until today, I always thought of his older brother as a baby.  But when I saw them side by side, I realized that this was not true.  Or if still a baby, he is definitely at a different stage in his baby life.  He looked so huge compared to his baby brother!  It really made me think about how we see things, and how much our view of things can change when compared to something else.  Then the lesson was really pounded home.  My "kitten" Lux, who I always thought of as a tiny little cat, is  bigger  than the baby!  It all just goes to show that you should never view something from only one side.  Or maybe that everything is always changing.  Whatever the moral of this story is, I'm glad I learned it.  Praise God for showing us such amazing things!  He is so worthy to be praised!  Well, I'm going to bed now...  three posts today, wow.  I'll catch ya on the flip side!    God bless you.
I'm home alone and Maria is at work, so basically I have nothing to do.  Well, that's not entirely accurate.  I  could  go take a shower.  Yeah, I really should do that.   I made an amazing revelation today.  Ska is a form of reggae.  Who knew?  Oh well, I like it hahaha.   Now for the real reason that I made this post.  I just wanted to see what my blog page thing would look like with two posts on it lol.  Am I pathetic, or what?  Oh well, I don't care.  Catch ya later!    "You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power.  For you created all things, and it is by your will they exist and were created."  -Revelation 4:11          God bless you.
Well, I'm starting to get pumped up for LIFE 2004.  Since this is my first post, I'll fill you in on what LIFE is.  My youth group will be heading for Phoenix, AZ on Monday morning to gather together with tens of thousands of teenagers for a week long convention, where we are going to worship our Lord Jesus Christ through music, concerts, services, seminars and much more!  As you can imagine, I'm a little bit excited for it!  The only thing that scares me is the flight to Phoenix.  I've never been on a plane before.  But Maria tells me that it's going to be okay, and that I'm going to survive and that I'll be back in Pennsylvania in a little over a week!  I don't know if I believe that yet.  Well, I haven't showered today, so I think I might just do that now.  I'm new to the whole blog thing, so if I have more than one post today, it's because I am excited at the fact that I have this online journal type thing.  It's kind of cool, I must say.  I'll conclude with a quote I made up, and I think everyone should hear...       "Even though the clouds may be gray, the sky above is  always  blue."        God bless you all.
If I could describe my life to you in two words, I have just done it.  I'll do it again.  Band Camp.  8 am to 3 pm every single day.  Not that I don't like it, because I do.  I don't really have a lot to say though.  Tonight, I'm selling my speakers, and hopefully going to make eighty dollars.  So I'm looking forward to that.  Me and my sister are going to try to put our money together and buy one of those motor bikes from Wal Mart.  Wish us luck in that.  Well, I think I'm going to check my email now, and then make a prayer list.  I'll catch ya later.    God Bless you.
Yesterday, as some of you may know, was Friday the 13th.  So my sister and I decided to get a group of kids together and honor the dead.  We went to the old Catholic cemetery in Clearfield around 8 pm.  First we fixed a few tombstones that had fallen over.  Unfortunately we couldn't fix them all, as some of them were too heavy to budge, even with four people lifting.At 9 pm the church bell rang.  We could barely hear it, because the races were too loud.  But we did hear it.  After it was done we gathered together and I gave a speech.  These are the exact words...       "To the Dead, now on this, the thirteenth day of August, in the year of our Lord two-thousand four, we gather here together to honor your lives, mourn your deaths, and patiently await your resurrection in Christ Jesus.  Amen."  After the speech, we shone our flashlights on every tombstone we could see.  We tried not to miss any.  The dead even got a fireworks show last night, even though I'm not sure where the fireworks were coming from.  The amazing thing about the whole night was that it made us all feel like we had done something good, and big, something we couldn't understand.  Maybe something we didn't need to understand.  But I'll tell you one thing, that cemetery feels so alive.  It's strange.  I'm not sure what I believe about ghosts or spirits yet.  I can only turn to the Bible for answers, so that is where I will turn.  But if those spirits really were there, I bet they appreciated what we did for them.    God bless you all, living and dead.
Whoo!  Sitting on a plastic lawn chair playing Game Boy for eight hours a day at the fair will pay off today!  Literally.  Hahaha.  I am almost scared.  I'm not used to having money.  I don't even remember what money is used for.  Maybe I will remember someday.  I am going on a date tomorrow!  I'll update this later, I have to go take my mom for soap powder now.  Catch ya later!    God Bless you.
Today was a lazy day.  I haven't showered, I haven't seen my girlfriend, and I ate a lot.  Mat came over today, which was a pleasant thing.  I feel bad though, because I told Maria I would call her, and I didn't.  I'm going to have to apologize next chance I get.  I've done a lot of apologizing today.  I just hope I can get forgiven by certain people.  I think I need to examine my own opinions and sympathies, because it seems lately I have offended a lot of people.  Pray for me in that.  I'll update this again soon, tomorrow probably.  I'll catch ya later.    God Bless you.
Hey, the fair is over, which means once again I am out of a job.  I met Clay Aiken's tour bus, by making it turn around and leave my entrance.  Clay Aiken is a big baby by the way.  Tonight at the fair, his dinner was ten minutes late, so he threw his plate of spaghetti across the room and upended a table, followed by a childish fit.  Very mature.  And then to top it all off, this chic called me a jerk simply because I told her all the stuff Clay did that was quite loserish.  She's so obsessed with his hottness that she couldn't even see the way he was acting.  She told me "stars need special treatment...  you wouldn't understand."  Right.  I forgot that famous people are better than normal people, just because they were blessed with a voice.  I can't help it that Clay Aiken's tour bus is larger and more amazing than my house!  (that's not a lie)  Well, I'm mad now that I was so insulted by that girl.  I'm outta here.  In future blogs I will try to refrain from complaining.  It's not good, and I'm kind of sorry that I've done it now.  But I'm gonna post this anyway, because I don't want to retype it all.  have a nice night!    God bless you.
I have returned from Phoenix, and I'm so tired that I can barely function.  I have to do fair parking today, it hurts my heart a little because Maria in her past three emails told me she couldn't wait to see me today, and unfortuneately, we cannot be together on this day.  That sucks.  By the way, for the kid who asked, Maria is my girlfriend, so now you know who she is.  I just wish I could see her today, but I guess there's nothing that can be done about it.  I'm exhausted, so I'm gonna wrap this up.  God is amazing, there's no denying it.  In future blogs, I will try to tell some of the amazing things I experienced at LIFE in arizona.  But until then, see ya later!   God bless you.
