Several years ago, I went with several friends to Buckhead, which is outside of Atlanta.  We went to several bars looking around having some fun.  We decided to go to this particular one.  We all sat down and there was this big open window.  I sat on the ledge of the window and I was "people-watching" that was walking by.  All of a sudden, I saw this girl riding piggyback on this guy.  I was paid attention to them and they passed by.  As they passed this tree, he tripped and the girl literally flew over him and busted her teeth on the pavement.  After trying to get up, she picked up her broken teeth pieces and put it in her hand.  She was so drunk and had this crazy look on her face, saying, "my teeth... my teeth".  I was laughing so hard.. it was so funny.  I think the guy was trying to console her.  It was so funny that she fell right in front of me.  Wow, that's entertainment at the window!  Here's another story: A co-worker and I decided to walk down to Chik-Fil-A for lunch.  Let me go ahead and give the name... her name is Lavern.  We got our lunch and carried it back to our office.  Lavern wanted to heat up her food in the microwave in the employee lounge.  I said, okay, let's go.  She asked me if she can put the whole thing in the microwave.  I told her as long as there is no metal or aluminum paper in the bag, it was fine.  Well, she put it in and then walked to the other side to get a drink.  I was standing next to the microwave and all of a sudden, I see flames.  Yes, huge flames inside the microwave with sparks.  I was like, oh my gosh, what in the world to do?  I immediately opened the door and tried to blow the fire out.  There is Lavern running over next to me... saying what??? What should I do?  She asked me if she can open her Dr. Pepper or whatever she had and pour on it.  I said, hell no!  Make it bigger!  So, I just pulled the damn thing out of the microwave and patted it out.  It was so embarrassing with all these people standing next to us watching.  Lavern ran out to get the security guard.  What in the world is a security guard going to do, arrest me?  As soon as we got it out, I walked out of the lounge.  Lavern was trying to make this all my fault!  Okay, whatever, I'll take the blame. 
Good morning.  I guess I better introduce my harem of women.  Some of you know about it, some of you don't.. so close your jaw.  I can see you with your jaw dropped.  Just close it.  Get over it.  Sure, I keep them all balanced out.  Everyone gets equal treatment.  I have:   Pimp Daddy -  none other than me, Raoul  Three-timing wife -  Virginia  Vixen -  Sandy, also known as Elderlynn  Jezebel -  Beth, Sandy's sister  Ho -  Kathy  Bimbo -  Colette, yes, she has that bimbo laugh and blonde hair  Dominatrix -  Stacey  Paramour -  Marti   
Hello all!  What a weekend!  It sure was wild.  If you read the comments made by Kathy, yes, I helped picked out some undies.  She wanted my opinion.  I have a good opinion... think about it.  The training went well and it went by fast.  It was a good crowd of 39 folks.  When Sandy asked me where we ate in Birmingham, I replied with Wings.  She laughed too hard.  I KNOW I KNOW... that is here in Montgomery as well.  Oh well... we love Wings.  And boy was I full afterwards!  We also went to the Galleria after the training.  Thank goodness we stopped somewhere as I was trying to tighten my seat belt some more... it wouldn't.  It was pouring down rain and Kathy wanted to get the folks out of her way and move!  Ooooh, road rage!  Wifey has a story about road rage... now I am not sure if I want to ride with her or I might get shot!    I bought a boat Sunday.  I was very excited!  After a year, my parents and I finally found a boat.  I am so ready to get it out on the water.  My dad and I doing small things to it to shape it up and then it's set to go!  Gotta get some skis and a tube then we can party hard on the water!  It is blue, my favorite color and has a walk-through.  It can take up to 8 people in it.  I am ready to pull someone on the tube and whip them!  Any volunteers?   
Hello!  It's Friday!  It's all I can say.  Time for a relaxing weekend!  Well, most of the weekend.. still got to do that training in Jefferson County.  That shall be fun as Kathy from the office is going with me.  It'll be a wild ride... not too wild, her son is going with us.  I just finished typing the minutes for the Family Support Center today, after procrastinating them for one month!  I am glad we don't have a Board meeting every month.  Just every two months.  I had lunch with Susan today at Felix's.  It was delicious and I know I ate too much, as usual.    To give you information:  Family Support Center is in Prattville, a non-profit organization designed to help others in the community such as GED, parenting, adult education, family-school partnership, job placement, etc.  I am on the Board of Directors as the Secretary/Tresurer.  Susan Cranfield is a great friend of mine and is the Executive Director of the center.  She was my high school teacher and we became good friends.   What else is going on with me... hmmm... let's see... not much but relaxing this evening watching tv, balancing several checkbooks to the penny, paying bills, and watching more tv.  And my two girls are looking at me wanting to go outside... so I better let them out.  Until next time!
Good afternoon!  It's almost Friday!  It has been a busy week.  I will be conducting a training this Saturday in Jefferson County at the Sheriff's Academy.  That's a fun Saturday, to be working.  Its not too bad though.  I like to do trainings.    I guess for those of you who don't know me...  I am an accountant for the State of Alabama Crime Victims Compensation Commission and have been with them for four years.  I love my job, but can be stressful at times.  I recently graduated from TSUM with a Masters in Business Administration.    Just two more months until the cruise!  Going with three of my good friends to the Bahamas in September.  My friend Lisa, who is a travel agent with Alabama World Travel, won the cruise and she gets to take three others along.  FUN FUN FUN.  Check out Lisa's website at  urlLink http://djsleeze.blogspot.com  .    Until next time!
Good morning all!  What's going on with you?  I am in a co-worker's office this morning.  She says I am anti-social.  Too bad wifey.  I am finally finished with softball this season.  We did pretty bad!  We were ranked #8 out of 12 teams, even made it to the tournament.  We had to play two games in the tournament and lost both games.  I even got to see two bodies slam each other.  And there was a six-month pregnant lady playing on the other team pitching and running.  What a crazy world we are in.  Tell me what's going on with you.  Post me some comments!  Until next time!
Hello Everyone!  Welcome to Raoul's World.  I am just trying this out to see if I like it or not... and will have time to do this...  You know me, always busy!
Hmmm... seems like there is a guy in my office that is jealous because I helped pick out some panties for the office ho.  Tooooooo bad, Tony!  Get over it.  The ho looks great today... with the right outfit on.. right length skirt and just the right top with the cut down to the cleavage.  Whoooo.. yeah, baby.  Let's get that on!  Let's see... story time.  Got to think of another story.  Not as funny as the others...   We went on a haunted hayride trip.  Several of us from Auburn (while I was in school there) got together to go to Montgomery to go to the Haunted Hayride way out in the country in Montgomery.  My friend Lisa was in charge of this trip.  She got the directions, etc.  There was so many cars (I think around four or five, can't remember).  I was riding with Shannon and her then boyfriend.  Lisa was in front with Carlton, a freak.  I would not ride with him so I got Lisa stuck with him.  I am sorry, Lisa.  Anyway, we got to Montgomery.  We found a fire station and we all pulled over.  Lisa was trying to call for more directions, but nobody would answer.  The person I was riding with was a driving maniac.  On with the story...  we moved on further out and found this dirt road off to the right.  We were on Woodley Road.  We drove down for miles on this dirt road... we could hardly see the car ahead of us.  They were all flying because we could not keep up with Carlton.  He had a big truck.  We turned around and went back to Woodley.  And then went to the other side of Woodley and pulled over at a church.  Turned around again... with Lisa still trying to call the place and no answer.  Then there they go off again, back to that dirt road and went down further.  We finally see the end of the dirt road... mind you, I was holding on to the sides of the Jeep that we were in... holding on for dear life and the wind blasting at the plastic windows.  I probably had a headache, but wasn't paying any attention.  Once we got to pavement, we went on further until the middle of nowhere.  We pulled up in front of this two trailers.. and turned around.  The jeep driver decided to pull off and drive up the bankment and couldn't get all the way up.  I thought we were going to flip over.  I am so glad we didn't.   Anyway, after all of us turned around, we started off again, really fast.  All of a sudden, we were all stopped in the middle of the road, lined up one behind the other.  I couldn't figure out what was going on!  Then I happen to look on the side of the road and there was a deer, trying to live.  Yes, Carlton hit the deer and scared the shit out of Lisa.  He was so mad that it dented the bumper of his truck.  Shannon was yelling, let's get the hell out of here.. my life is more important than that deer.  Carlton had to put the deer out of misery.  Poor deer.  We decided to go back to Auburn as it was over an hour just driving around.  Oh, point in fact, there was this big woman out on the porch of the trailer looking at all of us in her nightgown.  Just standing there watching all of these people all over the road.  Good grief.  We went on back through the dirt road and to a gas station in town.  The cars were filled with yellow dust.  We had to wash the windshields to see better.  Carlton had to call home to report the accident and Lisa got out and got into another car, with her eyes so wide.  So, did we ever have the haunted hayride?  Or, was that the haunted ride?
