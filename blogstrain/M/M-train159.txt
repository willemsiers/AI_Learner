urlLink    Well, I'm back.  Instead of the picturesque scene you saw represented below, reality looked more like what you see above.  the weather varied between sprinkling, raining, and snowing (just those three), and the trail had't been maintained in a while.  lots of underbrush grown over the trail, logs to climb over or under, and snow drifts to hide the trail all added up to one soaked christopher by the time I set up my tent (at that point wherever I could find a flat spot big enough).  Chock one up to experience.  there were were two nuggets of wisdom validated on this trip:  Always take a change of clothes to leave in the car for the ride home; and, alway take a roll of (emergency) plastic tape.  The reason for the first one is obvious, the second one was validated this morning when I woke up to six inches of fresh snow that obscured my path the night before.  I would have been bummed if I hadn't marked my trail.  The Lord is good, and there will be other weedends for adventure (like next weekend).   urlLink
Check this out! somebody with far too much time on their hands constructed a map of springfield (not oregon) by watching episodes of the simpsons and noting geographical markers.  Ever wondered what streets Homer uses to get to work?  Neither have I, but now you can know anyway!   urlLink Guide to Springfield USA
urlLink    Well, maybe this picture will give you a better idea of the sort of place I am going.  Maybe.  urlLink
urlLink    I will be here for the weekend:  Jefferson Park.  I promise to bring back lots of pictures.  (Hopefully the threat of rain will drive away any crowds) (also, hopefully but less likely it will not rain)  urlLink
This is great!  Thus, my first deposit: I think questions are good.  (Hey!  What do you expect for two cents?)
There is a new feature on my  urlLink website .  (Drumroll please....) Question of the week!  Every week I indend to have a new question open for discussion on an adjacent  urlLink blog .  Give us your 2c.

urlLink    recent picture of my little bro.  pretty menacing, huh?  urlLink
Okay, so I'm new to this whole thing... but what a better place to stretch my wings than Chris' blog.  :)
Here it is! the website, as you already know is off the ground (even if not fully constructed), and this blog will serve as the forum.  If you want to participate in this forum email me and I will send along an invitation.  Also, for those of you with newsreaders (go here if you don't have one but want one: http://www.rssreader.com/) this is my rss feed for this blog:  http://christopherlayton.blogspot.com/atom.xml
urlLink Gifford Pinchot National Forest - Campground Information   Hey Chris,   This is your test to see if the button on my google toolbar works.  And, oh look -- fires are allowed at the Forlorn Lakes!  Yippee!
Well, I've been a part of this blog for a couple weeks, I though I'd better quip in quick with my 1.5c.  (Sorry, I'm Ã¼ber-poor...)
Titanic in 30 seconds, re-enacted by bunnies.  yes, you heard (or, in this case, read) that correctly.    urlLink Titanic in 30 seconds with bunnies. : "Titanic in 30 seconds, re-enacted by bunnies."
urlLink    This just in:  Linus is moving to portland next week.  Why, you ask, should you care?  I don't really know.  (see the preceeding post)Linus is the ubergeek,  See  urlLink slashdot  article; urlLink
Okay, I laughed out loud - and (whew!) didn't score too highly (24.45759% - Geek) on the Geek test - how did you score? let me know.  urlLink The Geek Test
Hey, lookie here, a new question for a new week.  urlLink Question of the Week
[experiencing technical difficulties]  Or, at least I was.  If you've wondered why posts have been lacking lately, it is because I finally chucked my Microsoft CD's out the window.  I am operating on a "brand new" computer:  the same hardware now running  urlLink Fedora Core 2  (formerly Red Hat Linux)  I don't have everything up and running yet (DVD video, TV tuner, some other things aren't configured yet) but I was pleasently suprised just how much worked "out of the box" (iPod, SATA RAID, dual head monitor/dual video cards, etc).  It is looking good and running notably faster than under XP.  Anyhow, I am up and running again.
Some food for thought...   urlLink Chicago Declaration of   Tim recently pointed out an article to me on social/political issues in the evangelical Church.  I found it thought-provoking and wanted to share. Good food for thought....   urlLink Main Article     urlLink Reader Responses
It look as if the Sailhamer course at Western this summer will be held July 12-16 10am-5pm.  The class will be about the book of  urlLink Genesis   Have you any vacation time to spare?! (having taken several classes from the Good Doctor, I say it is worth it.)
According to  urlLink JK Rowling's website , the Half-blood Prince is neither Harry nor Voldemort.  We know that Harry is a pure-blood, but if it's not Voldemort, then who?  My money's on Hagrid, who is two half-bloods; giant and wizard.  I know it sounds weird, but it sounds weird enough to make sense in Rowling's world.  Or it may be a new character...  And, oh man, did I just tip my hand as a geek...  Though I only scored 26.4% on the test...
Ah, yes; Let the madness officially begin:  the Title of the sixth Harry Potter book was released today by J.K. Rowling, though no word yet as to when to expect publication.  I, personally was a late-comer to the Harry Potter madness; but I did read the fifth book (Order of Phoenix) in one sitting on the day it was released, so I guess you could say I have caught the bug.  Oh, by the way the title is "Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"  Any speculation on who this "Half Blood Prince" is? urlLink The Next Harry Potter Book
this has surfaced in my life several times; it surfaced again.  For our mutual edification:   MY LORD GOD, I have no idea where I am going. I do not see the road ahead of me. I cannot know for certain where it will end. Nor do I really know myself, and the fact that I think that I am following your will does not mean that I am actually doing so. But I believe that the desire to please you does in fact please you. And I hope I have that desire in all that I am doing. I hope that I will never do anything apart from that desire. And I know that if I do this you will lead me by the right road though I may know nothing about it. Therefore will I trust you always though I may seem to be lost and in the shadow of death. I will not fear, for you are ever with me, and you will never leave me to face my perils alone. - Thomas Merton   For those who must have a bibliographical reference, here it is:  Merton, Thomas.  Thoughts in Solitude.  New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 1958. Pg. 83
For those of you who use a rss reader (go  urlLink here  or  urlLink here  if you need a free one) will be glad to see a "read the bible in a year" rss feed sponsered by the ESV people. urlLink ESV Bible RSS Feeds  they have verse a day at random, "good" verse a day, and several differing options on how one might read through the bible in a year all syndicated via rss 2.0.  Very cool stuff. A couple of other cool feeds:  the   urlLink weather forcast /report customized by you, ;  urlLink the word of the day , and the  urlLink feed for this Blog ; great stuff. also, though I don't use it, there is a news reader plug in for firefox ( urlLink aggreg8 ) as well as for Internet Explorer ( urlLink pluck )
FYI. I will be preaching in Colton this Sunday - no, not at Colton Community Church, but next door at Canyon Creek Community Church.  The Text is 2 Cor. 5:16ff.  "For our sake he made hime to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God." (v21)
Ever wonder what the masses are thinking about?  How about the Blogging masses.  Now you can know, thanks to  urlLink blogdex .  This site is like a google news for weblogs.  Blogdex's webcrawler pays attention to what sites weblogs are being linked to, and then posts the most popular sites.  This is a pretty accurate way of "polling" what people are reading/paying attention to, since most blogs  (like this one) use links to provide context for their comments.  Blogdex also has a  urlLink rss feed .
Today the near miraculous happened, I enrolled for classes this fall at PSU.  Praise be to God (and, by the way Lord, I'm not sure how this is getting payed for yet...).  So, you might ask (actually, you didn't so I asked for you) what am I taking?  PHL324 Intro to Formal Logic ENG490U Rhetoric ENG308U Top:  Literature and the Enviroment ENG340U Medieval Literature  BTW I have declared "Liberal Studies" as my major, which is a short-hand way of saying that I get to take pretty much what I want to take.  And there was much rejoicing.
okay guys, this is crazy - so crazy in fact that I thought it was a hoax until I started seeing the photographic proof that these people are actually giving away iPods.  So I signed up.  If you want a free one you should sign up too.  But first read  urlLink  this  and make sure to sign up using me as a  urlLink referral   urlLink freeiPods.com   Okay if that wasn't enough you can use the same company to get yerself a free 27" Sony WEGA flatscreen TV  urlLink FreeFlatScreens  again use my  urlLink referral code   The Hitch:  1:  You have to sign up for a free offer (you know how those work - sign up and cancel before they start charging you AND 2:  You have to refer so many people (5-8) who each have to sign up for an offer. Is this a pain?  Yea kinda, but if it means getting a free iPod or TV out of the deal I can live with it.

urlLink    I went to the street of dreams (and, yes, dreamed) today, and found that the houses all (with the exception of the house pictured above) of the houses occupoed a fairly narrow design niche: NW.  Hmm.  I wonder why this is.   urlLink
