Man that would be a kick-ass song.  ah well, I've been doin very little today.  check it out (like anyone is reading this).   ~*~   ~*~   ~*~
Howdy ya'llins... ok, back to my regular non-redneck accent. Today was absolutely beautiful, I got to spend most of it with danielle so thats probably why. you'll hear aaaall about it, (not the parts meant only for me ;) MINE!) Here goes!   ~*~ ~*~ ~*~
First of all, i would like to explain the preceding post.  Danielle and I were talking last night and we both knew what we were both thinking, so we just said it.  Both her and I proffessed each others love for one another.  I literally hit the floor in happiness.  Its one of those things where, you've been wanting to say something for years, and you finally say it.  *Breathe in* ahh... I feel like screaming again, but i wont because i just remembered what happened last time.  Anyway, This Blog is more or less to talk about my upcoming CD.  It's not a story of my day or anything, but, what the hell.     ~*~   ~*~   ~*~      I love the little wavy guys.  Anyway, My new CD "It's all Black and White to Me" is an all acoustic version of all my songs.  I'm workin my way up to getting 12 or 13.  so far I have 4 and in the process of writing another.  I think they are comming out very nicely, i've got a preview of the album right here:
HOO-FUCKIN-RAY!!!
do it!     ~*~   ~*~   ~*~     BUZZ, BUZZ, BUZZ... ... ... *waking up out of a dream*  No, i... i want you to stay.  why do yo have to leave, why can't it be the way it used to be.  then i could tell you what i really meant to say... if only i could... if only i... if only.   "Oh my god... ... ... did i leave the backdoor unlocked?!"  Yup, thats right.  I had another encounter with the dead last night.  this one was stranger though, because two people were there, i won't mention their names, but one of them is still alive today.  It was rather creepy.  So i get up and run to the shower again, this time i scream inside until i fell down.  and then i literally, couldn't get up for 5 minutes withough falling down again.  when i got out of the shower, I kept feeling a rush of dizzyness.  Maybe screaming till i passed out wasn't the best idea.  Then i got all my guitars (3) and accessories and went to work downstairs.  I was gonna be teaching danielle today for the first time.  Teaching is so hard!  more on that later.  So after about 2 hours of sitting on the couch waiting for my coffee/student to show up, she finally came.  coffee and muffin in hand.  I wanted a banana nut muffin, but that wasn't all that important.  I really only needed Coffee to start the lesson.  but when whe got downstairs, there wasn't much teaching going on.  We chatted for a while and played some pool.  then i picked up the guitar and wailed on it playing some awesome riffs.  Danielle didn't seem to like that very much, so she got me by asking me to play pinball wizard (i don't know how to play it).  Thats when the lesson began.  I taught her that each string's 5th is the next strings root.  took a little bit (not too long, i think i overdid it), but we got it down.  and then i taught her how to play hotcross buns.  and then she had to leave.  so after that i was pretty bored, we did however make plans to go to the WCCC Rock expo.  I can't wait to see Breaking Benjamin, Soil and all that other good stuff.  Kenny B, come with us!  You too josh :\  GUUUUUH, dinner is almost done so i think i'll finish the rest of this later.  bye.     ~*~  ~*~  ~*~   -Jim
Sometimes, we forget who we are, and need to be reminded by others.  We lose track of who we were and how we used to do things, and slowly become what society thinks we should be.   You are who you are, and nobody else.
aaaaAAAAAAND WERE LIVE!  Hi, I'm James Kinney and welcome back to action 7 news.  Today we have a great top story, man gets eaten by bamboo.  What kind of sentece does the bamboo serve?  more on that, at eleven.  But first, our lastest story, My day.      ~*~   ~*~   ~*~     
Good lord!  I am so bored!!!  and i really wish i had a fursuit.  anybody want to give me a fur suit?  cause then i could go to anthrocon and fit in :P  thats the other thing, i'm tired of not fitting in.  so I think i'll change my attitude or something.  anywho, here is today.  My writing skills are improving, and this one is a good one.
Part II.  ~*~   ~*~   ~*~
I'll be making another post tonight, but i felt like i had to get this one down now.  Today was... interesting.  Most of it was spent trying to wake up.  I was seriously lying in bed until 10 minutes ago.  I am begining to think my sleeping habits are becoming unhealthy...  anywho, here is the scoop. *harp sound*     ~*~   ~*~   ~*~     BUZZ, BUZZ, buzz, ....buzz... ... ...  "Hooray!  *snore*".  Finally, my damned alarm clock died on me.  I felt like dancing, well, no i didn't.  I felt like sleeping in.  So I slept, and slept, and slept.  But i woke up every hour to look at my watch and see what time it was.  and every time i did, i would say the same exact thing; "Shit, I have to get up... ... ... *snore*".  I couldn't believe that i did that 5 times.  I'm so ashamed :P  after about 5 hours of trying to get up, I stumble over to my drawing desk.  What do you think I would do at my drawing desk?  Draw, right?  wrong, i threw my head on the table and began to sleep.  this lasted for two more hours.  "huh, wha... ... (glances at watch)... ... I hate you alarm clock, why did you have to die today!".  I remember that i had to finish off a still-life drawing today to sell at the block party.  I had been drawing them for a week and have a total of 5.  I really hope i can make some money off of them, and get my name out there in the public.  This sort of interferes with my dream of being a rock star, but hey; artist, rock star, whats the difference.  So i finally stand up, go to the bathroom, and get into the possesed shower.  Yeah, that woke me up fairly quickly.  After spending a very unusually small amount of time in the shower, i go back to my drawing desk and try to work up the energy to finish the picture of the Diner with the old man out front.  But instead, i go over to my desk and turn on my laptop and begin to type this.  so as of now, i am just procrastinating.  and i will finish this later today.     To be Continued...     -Jim
Today was fine i guess.  except i had to go to work, and it was like, 90 degrees today.  But hey, at least i got to work the air conditioned stand.  and for those of you who have wandered on to this site and don't know where i work, i work at six flags new england as a vendor.  Life has its ups and downs, i'll go ahead and consider this one of my downs.  But the good thing that comes out of all this, is that i have job experience.  anywho, on with the show.    ~*~   ~*~   ~*~   
I got my first set of Prismacolor (tm)  Pencils the other day.  And let me tell you, they are absolutely brilliant.  I thought i might have been over-reacting when i was describing them to someone, but no.  They are just simply  that  amazing.  Lets start at the begining of the story, shall we?:    ~*~   ~*~   ~*~      BUZZ, BUZZ, BUZZ.  The alarm goes off, it says 8:57.  I glance at it, mumble the word "marf" under my breath, and bury my face into my pillow as i say to myself, "it's only wednesday...".  My life couldn't get any more dull.  I had to fight for a reason not to just sit there in bed and veg.  eventually, the reason came though.  unfortunate for me, it came in the form of 65 lbs of fur and drool.  My dog lunges at me to wake me up, I can't stand it, and i think he knows it :\  I look over at the alarm clock again, 9:30.  "I hate you with a passion" i says.  Time flew by pretty fast after standing in the shower staring at the wall for about 20 minutes.  and before i knew it, i was at my drawing desk, ready to draw.  I looked around for my set of cheap, no good colored pencils that are normally scattered amongst the clutter that is, "my desk".  but today was different.  "Wait a second... (pulls out shopping bag).  I shall suffer no more!  (pulls out prismacolor pencil set!)".  And there they were, all 48 of them, sitting inside the box just waiting to be opened.  Oh how sweet vicotry tastes my freind.  And when i finally open up the box that was my pride and joy, the taste of victory suddenly went bitter.  I open the box only to find that the pencils do not come presharpened.  "No need to worry, just a minor set-back is all."  i couldn't have been more wrong.  I go to my pencil sharpener and try to sharpen my pencils, but it wont fit.  I try and try, but it just wont fit!  I dig through every drawer in the house looking for a pencil sharpener and nothing will fit the little bundles of joy!  I finally give up and go plop down on my bed.  staring up at the ceiling, wondering why i was being punished so.  Then, it hit me.  I went into my closet, reached for a small box from when i was in first grade, opened it up and to my amazment: Saw my Penuts(tm) Pencil Sharpener!  I remembered that it had the extra wide hole for sharpening those thick pencils they used to give us in kindergarden.  I was well on my way to paradise!  i go to my desk, sharpen all my pencils, and get set.  I had my peice of paper in hand, my work space was clear, Reference pictures were at hand.  And alas!  nothing came to mind.  I had waited and waited for this moment, and I could not think of anything to cristen the S.S. Prismacolor with.  Fate is cruel, cruel and very unusual.  And every time something good happens to me, it gets worse and worse.  I take an old sketch of mine, grab my old red colored pencil, and begin to shade premiscuously.  "Pass the green... no... the other green."
I cannot stand that show.  I realize that i've just seen the first episode and all, but that show doesn't deserve a second chance.  For those of you who don't know (and i wouldn't blame you if you didn't, seeing as the show sucks), It's a show on the Fox netowrk where two families trade mothers or fathers.  Dave Chapelle made fun of the idea before it even happened on his "The Chapelle Show".  I think his randition of the show was better.  Back to the matter at hand, Trading Spouses is the biggest load of tripe that any scottsman could swallow.  Period.  Wow, I just now realized how much this was more of a movie review than a blog.  oh well.   -Jim
Lets get this strait.  I now have a blogspot?  Me?  The person who single handedly mocked and tore people down at the ankles for having one?  ...ok.  I suppose that i shouldn't be doing this, but its just so damn boring over here.  I only work a small amount per week and have way too much free time.  I have even published (almost published) and entire web comic, learned 12 songs on the guitar, and programmed 2 games  in the time i had.  and i have only had 1 month of free time.  god...kill...me...now!  So yeah, I'm gonna be bloging here from now own.  mainly because i'm just to lazy to make a blog site of my own.  I don't have anything to blog about for this post, so your out of luck for now.  adios.     -Jim
Today was hard on me.  Here is the version i didn't tell anybody cause they didn't need to hear it.  here goes:   ~*~   ~*~   ~*~
Pfft... I'll just type the damned thing!     ~*~ ~*~ ~*~
The good times...   The bad times...   The ones you love and care about...   Will all teach you...   The meaning of true happiness...     -Jim
