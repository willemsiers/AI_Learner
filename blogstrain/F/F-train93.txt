The year is AD 21XX... The galaxy is at peace after centuries of fighting the Reploid Wars... The moon is the center of a swarm of orbiting space colonies. The largest, a massive colony named Eurasia, is undergoing extensive renovation to make it the most colossal and most advanced of all the orbiting outposts. When an unknown evil force occupies Eurasia, the peace collapses! Eurasia's artificial gravity device is wrecked. The colony spins out of orbit, and is now headed on a collision course towards Earth! The outpost will hit Earth in 24 hours. If they collide, Earth could be totally destroyed. It could even vanish! The only way to shield Earth is to deploy Enigma, an ancient particla cannon left over from the Reploid Wars. The future of the planet is entrusted to Mega Man X and Zero.   X rushes to the last coordinates where Zero was heard from, with Alia guiding him. When he enters an empty room, Zero teleports in with his Z-Buster damaged. Pretty soon, Sigma appears, but X easily defeats him. Meanwhile, the colony has been leaking out a virus. Sigma purposely lost as a diversion while the Maverick Virus spread throughout the Earth, and the colony plummeted towards it. The only way to stop it is to deply Enigma, an ancient particle beam. For it to work, Douglass requests that you find 4 parts to strengthen it; The Crystal Ball from Grizzly Slash, The Orifalcon from Squid Adler, the Laser Device from Izzy Glow, and Hydrogen from Duff Mcwhalen.   Getting the 4 parts wasn't enough to destroy the colony, and it crashed into Earth. Mankind barely survived the impact, and are living underground until the reploids finish renovating the Earth until it is fit for living. X rushes to go find Zero's escape pod, and when he reaches there he find a mysteriously powerful energy aura. The owner of that energy aura was Zero, who floated above X and challenged him to a fight. In order to save his friend, X a

Mankind barely survived the impact, and are living underground until the reploids finish renovating the Earth until it is fit for living. X rushes to go find Zero's escape pod, and when he reaches there he find a mysteriously powerful energy aura. The owner of that energy aura was Zero, who floated above X and challenged him to a fight. In order to save his friend, X accepted. Before he could, though, 2 challenges awaited him; a black sludge maverick and a newly upgraded Rangda Bangda. Defeating them proved to be no simple task, as they were stronger than before. After finally dealing with the enemies of the past, X found himself fighting one of the fiercest battles of his life against non other than Zero. The Sigma Virus seemed to have strengthened him. After a long fight, both collapsed on the floor, exhausted and drained of their energy. Suddenly, Sigma appeared before them, and tried to take out the unconscious X. Zero jumped in and drove Sigma off, leaving yet another opponent for them to battle. Before Sigma, the previous 8 Mavericks arrived, but X was able to easily destroy them. X, after finally reaching Sigma's coordinates, found himself fighting the very cause of the whole problem: Sigma. Defeating him proved no simple task, but he managed to dodge energy wave after energy wave until is nemesis was destroyed. But as seen before, Sigma always comes back in a 2nd form. This time, a gigantic version of himself attempted to crush X, by smashing his hands together, shooting plasma blasts, and energy rings. X only barely destroyed him   But before he died, Sigma took Zero with him. With his body torn in half, Zero clung onto dear life. When X rushed over to check his friend's condition, Sigma, with his last breath, shot an energy beam at them. It piered both reploid's bodies, leaving a hole in both their chests. Trying to save x, Zero used the last of his power to finish off Sigma. With no energy left, the life ran out of him. X, meanwhile, was dying fast, until a mysterious spirit appeared, and nursed him back to health. 3 years later, a maverick was spotted, and Alia alerted X, now a captain, to bring the new Hunters to solve the problem. Now carrying Zero's old beam saber, X rushes into battle, never forgeting his brave friend
