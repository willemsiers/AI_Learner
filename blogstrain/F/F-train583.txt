dear B,      good God, heaven saves me...   what was just happened..   **   news flash   ** my sweet blue car got hit by a motorbike, didn't do me any harm, but still... replacing the 'right-turn' front light is a must...      the accident happened around 5.30 pm today, i was just slowly driving my car away from the office exit gate, minding my own business, trying to tame the mid-heavy after-hours traffic crossing the road n on my way to my usual daily U-turn... i went on my granny's speed trying to catch up other vehicles to get to the U-turn when suddenly... " BANG!!! "... 2 boys on a motorbike hit my car as they attempted to overtake my car from the outrageous RIGHT side... unbelievable...      well... they n the bike went down instantly after successfully throwing my right front light to the air n landed harshly on the grass pavement...    the stupid boy rushing towards me as i opened my side window n he started yelling the stupidest things i've ever heard my entire live... "hey lady, u supposed to give sign if u're gonna turn right!" and i screamed back, "hey!!! i've signed since i left the exit gate, look its still on! off course u cant see it now coz u've managed to put it there on the grass, u dumb ass! now get ur ass over there (my finger pointing to the other side of the road) lets finish this off, right now!!!"       hmm... what happened next is... at first i put on a good fight and played the grown up mature lady's nice n easy attitude (even offered to take them back to my office clinic to get first aid for their bruises n wounds) and i wrapped it up with 'their registration and his dad's name plus a complete home address + phone number' on my hand as i told him to go to hell... naah!! im too nice... i just told him to go home...       apparently he's under age n dont have a licence yet... geez.. that's just grrreat... what else's new... kids!!!... he's begging to swap the registration with his student ID ** As If!!!** He kept on saying that he's scared the police might catch him on the road without licence n registration... good Lord!!...       people surrounded us... couldn't careless... hell with them... what's on my mind that time was only how i could fix the car right away and how much its gonna cost me... wait til my sister 'the lioness' found out... i'll be hanging up side down from the 101st floor sky craper somewhere in a woop woop land for the rest of my pathetic life watching all the most eligible bachelors i dreamed of remarried for the uncountable times and if im lucky i could be in my normal gravitation mode when i reached the age of 40... that's what's on my mind...       tried to get home ASAP and spit the breakout news to mom and called the boy's Dad right away... talked to the undecisive older sister instead, said dad's not home yet maybe after 8, only a sick sleeping mom at home, and a scared not-home-yet-either boy... temporary dead end...      be nice... be nice... stay calm... u'll be fine... that's whats on my head over n over while eating my instant fried noodle that no longer express its brand name "Delicious Noodle"... FUDGE!!! not only the accident caused me losing my fabulous appetite but do u know how long it takes when u wait for the time to come... Ages!!! 60 minutes of pain and suffer...      finally, 8.04 i went straight to the phone and dialled that number again... the Dad picked it up in 2 rings!! whoaaa... guess he's been expecting me... i was nice, friendly, mature... he behave too... until... SHITake mushroom, man!!!     <span style="c
dear B,     tell u d truth, i hardly ever let anyone knows anythn anymore bout my live this past view years let alone writing bout it on purpose n publish it on d net for all both worlds to see..    its just too damn scary imagining that what i wrote bout stuff...really really ridiculously BIG NO NO's stuff i've encountered...was read by unwanted eyes..   so i guess its a big turn for me...      i may not have anythn important to write about right now,but i must force myself to start...   hmm.. let see.. my job sucks..mm..like that's somethn new..no its not!! not for the past three years...but its been like hell since 2 of my best bud left..n leaving this pile of unfinished works n problems..hey..thats fine..its not like that i still need my after-work social life or anything...after all thats what friends are really for, right...  Wrong !!!  Friends dont go n leave their so called friend at war to die...or watch her bleed from a distance...far out, girls!!  they stick around... they stand beside you every time... they always be behind you to catch you when you fall or to watch your back in case any other "friend" trying to stab you from behind... its what i believe to be a good friend really are...      pheew...!!! glad i spit it out... been holdin it back for ages now... u see, coz i always be the brave one amongst my group.. at least thats what naked eyes sees me... so when each one of my buddies left, others think that i couldn't careless... that it wont affect me or anything... coz im d superwoman... i can handle it... piece of 'baked cheese' cake!    part of it, is true... i could handle the "handed-over" stuff, thats the easy part... the hard part is that i must continue each battle all by myself now... we've won some battles, but we haven't won the war!!! now that i must go solo, it's gettin harder n harder... it was hard before n its even more harder now... it's not that i can't do it alone... it's just that i doubt how much strength i have left to fight and figuring out the tactic all together... do i have enough just to still be alive when i finally be the conquerer... will you guys be there to celebrate with me...
Akhir Mimpi    Kembali mungkin ingat terkenang Lembar berhias kawat dan benang Jarak dan waktu kian terbentang Pengikat lepas tak sengaja terbang  Pulih memang diantar sang waktu Bukti hanya satu penawar pilu Pikir dan nalar bisu membeku Kala hati tak kuasa membiru  Jika dulu rapuh menetap Tak ubah ruang yang tak kedap Galau dicipta bisik penghasut Hadirkan remang tertutup kabut  Bila mimpi tak kunjung akhir Kapankah indra mampu bekerja Sinar bulan jemputkan takdir Yang tak benderang harus bercahaya  Jika sang putri kembali terlahir Kan kemilau indah bertatah berlian Kian mewangi seiring angin semilir
Rentang Nasib   Gelap dan hening tampakkan dirimu Dalam kesendirianku syahdu mengalun Walau mungkin senja terlalu biasa Kemanakah sang purnama beranjak  Kilau yang tak menyilaukan Temaram dan tersamar mega Aura dingin pancarkan damai Jauh naungan tak hingga tak henti  Doa mengalir terucap pasti Puji dan syukur Yang Maha Suci HadirMu dalam hati dan jiwa Berserah diri atas kuasa  Sesaat batin memaksa menepi Fenomena kini membelah mimpi Takdirkah yang sengaja hadir Atau sapaan halus pengawal akhir  Sampaikah waktuku di penghujung Sempatkah harap maksudku berkunjung Tempatku disini merentang nasib
